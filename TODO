Finish high school league export
    After the current players there will be autogenerated players
    Figure out how to make the players 14 during draft and 15 after draft is over for a more realistic experience

Finish work on the asian g league & path in between high school & nba
    modeling off of the NBA2k my career in china
    serves as a college & as a g league for caps
    so there can be caps still in college and vet caps both in there
    For caps, boost all ratings by 10 to make it easier to play in g league (more realistic that way)
    When caps make nba, they get sent to g league if they play 0 minutes, or they get sent to g league automatically if they are they dont get drafted
    They make it back to nba by getting over 25 minutes of PT for 2 consecutive weeks of bball (only for players previously in nba or out of college)
    For choosing the g league team a random spinner is chosen (I like the one on wheel decide)
  
  

Start work on the NBA league:
    Is it Real Teams
    Is it the preset teams from bbgm
    Is it custom teams that we create from scratch -- higher quality teams and more authentic experience but harder to do

Overall Consistency
    develop schedule
    sim all three leagues at the same time
    have off days for management
    keep all exports organized and consistent
